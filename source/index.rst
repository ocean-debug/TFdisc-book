Welcome to TFdisc's documentation!
========================================

TFdisc is a python library for Transcription factor perturbation simulation. TFdisc uses wild-type single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data to emulate corresponding scRNA-seq transcriptomes post-TF perturbations.TFdisc generates inferred transcriptomes for individual cells with single or multiple TFs perturbed. This simulated perturbed single-cell expression data mirrors actual experimental results, facilitating a wide range of downstream analyses.
